        "fdt4000": "The FDT 4000 On-Vehicle Brake Disc Lathe Machine is designed to remove scratches, wear, and warping from brake discs over time, ensuring a longer lifespan for the brake disc. By grinding your old brake disc instead of replacing it, you gain economic benefits and, contrary to popular belief, a safer driving experience. This is because old brake discs become harder under high pressure and heat during use. When the brake discs meet the manufacturer's standards, turning them for reuse is both a safe and economical choice for you and your vehicle.\n\nThe FDT 4000 On-Vehicle Brake Disc Lathe Machine is designed to allow the user to easily place the lathe on the vehicle and perform the most efficient turning operation in the shortest time. The advantage of turning on the vehicle without removing the disc is that the brake disc's balance adjustment remains intact during the turning process. Additionally, you can quickly perform the turning operation as needed without wasting time. With high-quality diamond tips and precise adjustment capabilities, you can achieve a turning thickness of 0.004 mm. Furthermore, the built-in alarm allows you to attend to other tasks during the turning process, as the machine will automatically stop and alert you with both audible and visual signals when the process is complete. The machine comes with two stands, short and long, allowing application on a lift, jack, or workbench.\n\nDisc lathe is a method used to correct deformations that occur over time, solve vibration problems in the braking system, or address issues with contamination or vibration in newly replaced discs and pads. This method helps achieve a smooth surface similar to that of a new disc. It reduces costs for the vehicle owner and enhances customer satisfaction by providing high-quality and safe service. Users should ensure that the discs do not fall below the minimum thickness specified by the manufacturer's standards.\n\nLathe can be performed manually or automatically.\n\nDetailed information regarding the use of the machine is available in the user manual.",
